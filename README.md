Linux config files

I currently use Manjaro with KDE, the breeze theme with my custom gruvbox color scheme, [Sierra Breeze](https://github.com/ishovkun/SierraBreeze) window borders, and latte dock.

* Breeze color scheme can be found in the share folder
* Konsole color scheme can be found in the konsole folder
* Oomox theme can be found in the oomox folder
* KDE config is in share
